# Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits: 
# 1634 = 1^4  + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 
# 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 
# 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4+4^4 
#  the sum of these numbers is 19316
# find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of the 5th power of their digits.
